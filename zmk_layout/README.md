# ZMK Firmware Conversion

This folder contains the ZMK configuration converted from the QMK layout in `rAboj`.

- All layers and behaviors from the QMK keymap are mapped to ZMK equivalents.
- Custom dual-function keys and tap dances are implemented using ZMK behaviors.
- See `config/` for keymap and behavior files.

## How to use
1. Copy these files into your ZMK config repo or use with a ZMK build system.
2. Adjust hardware settings as needed for your specific Ergodox variant.
3. Refer to ZMK documentation for advanced customization.
